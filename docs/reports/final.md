## Final Release Playtesting Reports
On the final playtest, we ran into some issues with our game that caused our game’s link broke, but we were able to do the playtesting in our local laptop and fix it our production build later.  After the final playtest, we received many valuable feedbacks form our peers that we wish to implement them in the future. One of them would be a mini map which indicates the player’s location in the room instead of an arrow. Another one would be audio for our game such as sound for our fighting scene. We hope to implement different views for our game beside our current top down view. Lastly, we also would like to improve our game design with better visuals and graphics.

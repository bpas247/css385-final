## Beta Release Playtesting Reports
THe main feedback recieved after the Beta playtest was that the physics of controlling the player were too chaotic. We also recieved feedback that the game controls and interactions were difficult and unknown to them. To address these main issues we first tweaked the physics of the player and enemies by lowering the forces applied to collisions and movement. This allowed for a more smooth gameplay but kept the funny ragdoll physics feel which was our main intentions for the physics. To aid in the players ability to learn all the mechanics and controls, a simple UI tutorial menu was created. This allowed the user to view all of the details of the game that are not obvious at first glance.

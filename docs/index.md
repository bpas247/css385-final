## Team Reflection
As a team, we are proud of the work we did and accomplished. We created a game from scratch with many ups and little downs and in the end created something that we even enjoy to play.

Our team came together and excelled mainly in communication, delegation, reliability, leadership and creating something fun. On a daily basis our team would discuss the work ahead of us. We quickly discovered each of our strong suits and work was delegated to utilize them. Every team member stepped up to the challenge and we were able to put trust in one another to finish the work delegated. On playtest we were able to see the enjoyment that many had whilst playing our game, making the hard work pay off.

If two additional weeks were give, the 3 main priorities would have been additional features, game design and game balancing/polishing. At the beggining of development our team had a very ambitious scope. Many features were unable to make it into the final build of production. Thus, it would be top priority to add more fun and enjoyable features to our game. With already very little time to add all the features we wished, the game was not the most cohesive when it came to design and style. We all wished we could make our game the prettiest however, getting core features at the time was the main priority. Lastly, our game was not only ambitious feature wise but mechanic wise. There were many features and mechanics that needed tweaks to make the game more enjoyable to the player. In the end we did not have much time to tweak our initial implementations. 

All in all we accomplished our main goals and worked as a team. The team created a wonderful work and collaboration environment and its sad to say that this is the end of our CSS 385 Game Development project.

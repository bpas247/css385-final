# Totally Accurate Fantasy RPG game 

## Description 
## Development Log 

### Paper Prototype

#### Theme

A top-down 3D ragdoll physics RPG dungeon crawler, aimed to be the most immersive (and accurate) fantasy RPG game created.

#### Mechanics

Travel from room to room, completing each objective(s) in each room and finding loot along the way.

#### Win/Lose

Win:
- Complete all of the objectives in every room.
- Defeat the final boss.

Lose:
- Fail an objective in any room (requires you to restart the room).

#### Achievements/Upgrades

##### Player Progression

The player will gain experience points, which will allow them to level up and gain skill points. These skill points can be used to increase the player's passive attributes (health, damage, armor, etc).

##### Loot
The player will be able to grab weapons that the enemies drop. These weapons will have random attributes assigned to them, which may or may not be better weapon(s) than the player has currently equipped.

#### Innovative

The ragdoll physics mechanic is heavily-inspired by the game `Totally Accurate Battle Simulator`. We are intrigued by the random chaos and inconsistency that this mechanic adds to the gameplay, and will also require us to use advanced Unity API's to implement.

#### Fun

Player progression, random chaos, rooms that follow different themes and emotions, final boss fight, wonky enemies, and much more provide a very unique yet hilarious gameplay.

#### Challenging

The ragdoll physics adds a bit of chance on whether or not your hits will connect with the enemy. The randomness of the loot drops adds a bit more chance, as you might have a playthrough that doesn't give you any good weapons whereas the next playthrough you could get one of the best weapons early on in the game.

#### Documentation of Assigned Work (individual logs)

##### Phuc's Log 

During the prototype process, I helped with brainbraiming ideas and mechenics for the games.  I also skeched out the 1st room filled up with objects  and the UI game scene with XP and heath process bars,  objectives box, and weapon box

##### Brady's Log

- initialized final project repository (this one).
- Deployed website via GitHub Pages and Jekyll.

##### Jeremiah's Log

During the creation of the paper prototype, I aided in brainstorming ideas of initial game flow. After our process I sketched a prototype level, the initial inventory UI and a prototype of what a weapon drop would look like in our game.
